## DropdownOpenContextType type

The context for the open/closed state of the dropdown menu. It provides a boolean `isOpen` that indicates whether the dropdown menu is currently open or closed.

If you are using the default [Dropdown()](./dropdown-menu.dropdown.md) component, you do not need to interact with this context directly. However, if you are creating a custom dropdown component, you can use this context to determine the open/closed state of the dropdown menu.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type DropdownOpenContextType = Readonly<{
    isOpen: boolean;
}>;
```
