## DropdownToggleContext variable

The context for the dropdown toggle component, which provides a function to request changes to that state. It also provides a ref that should be attached to the underlying DOM element rendered by the dropdown toggle, which allows the dropdown menu to position itself correctly relative to the toggle.

If you are using the default [DropdownToggle()](./dropdown-menu.dropdowntoggle.md) component, you do not need to interact with this context directly. However, if you are creating a custom dropdown toggle component, you can use this context coordinate with the dropdown menu.

The value received from this context has a stable identity and will never change between renders.

**Signature:**

```typescript
DropdownToggleContext: import("react").Context<Readonly<{
    requestOpenChange: (options: RequestOpenChangeOptions) => void;
    dropdownToggleRef: RefObject<HTMLElement | null>;
}>>
```
