## DisclosureIndicatorContextType type

The context type for the disclosure indicator of a dropdown item, which provides information about whether the submenu associated with the dropdown item is currently open or closed. This context is used by the default [DisclosureIndicator()](./dropdown-menu.disclosureindicator.md) component to determine the color of the disclosure indicator icon, but it can also be used by custom disclosure indicator components.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type DisclosureIndicatorContextType = {
    readonly submenuIsOpen: boolean;
};
```
